# Malaria-risk-modelling
Spatial modelling of malaria risk among children under 5 in Kenya

# Project Overview
This project uses spatial modeling techniques to assess malaria risk among children under five in Kenya. The analysis is based on health data from the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) and incorporates geographic data for spatial analysis.

## 1. Data
The primary dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the **Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS)** 2020. This dataset contains information on health indicators, demographic data, and other factors relevant to malaria risk among children under five.

Due to the sensitive nature of the dataset, it is **not shared publicly** in this repository. However, interested users can request access to the KDHS data from the [DHS Program website] Once access is granted, the data can be used to reproduce the analysis presented in this project.

### 2. Geographic Shapefiles
The project also uses geographic shapefiles for mapping the spatial distribution of malaria risk. The shapefiles include the administrative boundaries of Kenya.

## Methodology
The spatial modeling approach used in this project is adapted from Paula Moraga's work on disease mapping and spatial epidemiology. The R code used here follows similar procedures, with modifications to apply the model to malaria data in Kenya.
