# Malaria-risk-modelling
Spatial modelling of malaria risk among children under 5 in Kenya

# Project Overview
This project uses spatial modeling techniques to assess malaria risk among children under five in Kenya. The analysis is based on health data from the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) and incorporates geographic data for spatial analysis.

# Objectives
## Main Objective
To model malaria risk among children under five in Kenya.
## Specific Objectives
1.	To develop a spatial model to assess the distribution of malaria risk among children under five in Kenya. Using both rapid diagnostic test and microscopy test results
2.	To compare the spatial patterns and distributions of malaria risk derived from rapid diagnostic tests versus microscopy diagnostic methods among Kenyan children under five.

## 1. Data
The primary dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the **Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS)** 2020. This dataset contains information on health indicators, demographic data, and other factors relevant to malaria risk among children under five.

Due to the sensitive nature of the dataset, it is **not shared publicly** in this repository. However, interested users can request access to the KDHS data from the [DHS Program website] Once access is granted, the data can be used to reproduce the analysis presented in this project.

### 2. Geographic Shapefiles
The project also uses geographic shapefiles for mapping the spatial distribution of malaria risk. The shapefiles include the administrative boundaries of Kenya.

## Methodology
The spatial modeling approach used in this project is adapted from Paula Moraga's work on disease mapping and spatial epidemiology. The R code used here follows similar procedures, with modifications to apply the model to malaria data in Kenya.

## Results

This analysis includes spatial visualizations of malaria risk across different regions. The maps provide insights into the distribution of malaria risk among children under five and show the areas of high and low risk.

### Malaria Risk Maps

The provided maps illustrate the spatial distribution of malaria risk in Kenya. These visualizations highlight regions with varying levels of malaria incidence, which can guide targeted intervention efforts.
